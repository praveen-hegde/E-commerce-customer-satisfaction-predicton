Case study on customer review rating prediction using machine learning

E-commerce is the daily essential of our life now-a-days. E-commerce is the platform where a seller can sell products and customer can buy the products. That means e-commerce platform connects large number of sellers to customers through online. Providing better services to customers is one of the main keys to be successful as an e-commerce seller. 
How to measure the goodness of the service? 
The answer is: goodness of a service is based on customer satisfaction. If the customers are not satisfied with the services given by the seller, then seller has to focus on service quality to attract the customers, thereby improve the business. So, basically customer feedback plays crucial role in e-commerce business.

In this case study I am trying to predict customer review rating using Olist e-commerce dataset taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

Tools used : Python, Jupyter notebook, libraries: pandas, numpy,sci-kit learn, imbalanced learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Deployment using flask, demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KlVL-yA_Js&t=4s
